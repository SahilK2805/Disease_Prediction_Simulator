# Disease Prediction Simulator

## Overview
The Disease Prediction Simulator is a web-based application that predicts potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms using machine learning models. This project aims to assist users in identifying probable illnesses and taking timely precautions or consulting a healthcare professional.

## Features
- Predict diseases based on symptoms using machine learning models.
- User-friendly web interface for entering symptoms and viewing results.
- Supports multiple ML algorithms:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
- Displays possible remedies or precautions for the predicted diseases.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, flask, google.generativeai, dotenv, OS
- **ML Algorithms:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes
- **Database:** CSV file

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DiseasePredictionSimulator
   ```
3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset contains diseases and their associated symptoms. Example format:

| Disease | Symptom1 | Symptom2 | Symptom3 | ... |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|-----|
| Flu     | Fever    | Cough    | Fatigue  | ... |

## Machine Learning Models
The project uses:
- **Decision Tree:** For quick and interpretable predictions.
- **Random Forest:** For robust and accurate results.
- **Naive Bayes:** For probabilistic predictions based on symptoms.

## How It Works
1. User enters symptoms in the web interface.
2. The input is processed by the trained machine learning model.
3. The predicted disease(s) is displayed along with suggestions.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding a chatbot for personalized interaction.
- Integration of real-time healthcare databases.
- Enhanced user interface with symptom-suggestion dropdowns.
- Visual data insights (graphs, charts).
